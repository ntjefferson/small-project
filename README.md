This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

This is just a quick and fun application where users can create and select a superhero. Once you create a list (or use the existing list) of superheroes, you can sort them by various categories and select which ones you would want to take with you to battle!

Obviously once you select the superheroes, that's the end of the application. But it was a quick project made to showcase **React, Redux and Typescript expertise**. 

State management is done through **Redux, and testing of components/containers/reducers are done through Jest / Enzyme**.

## Get Started

1. Clone the project <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/ntjefferson/small-project.git`

2. Install dependencies from package.json file <br/>
`npm install`

### Run the application

To run the application in development mode, just use `npm start` and it will open up the application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Run tests

To launch the rest runner in interactive watch mode, just use `npm test`.

Tests were set up to make sure the container and presentational components render correctly. Tests were also set up so for the "hero" reducer, which was the only one.

Tests were set up use Jest / Enzyme.

Let me know if you have any questions! <br/>
